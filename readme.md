# CatalogUpdater.py

A python script I'm developing to aid in transferring the important information from a distrubuter's **Catalog** to a Seller's **Cost Price Files** and **Resale Price Files**

Made to work with excel .xlsx files only

--- 

How to Use:

1. Get your Template and folder and import it in main.py
2. Put distributer catalogs inside **/Inbox** folder
3. Run main.py
4. Check **/Outbox** folder

Still a WIP I would not reccomend using this yet
