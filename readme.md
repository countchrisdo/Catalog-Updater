# CatalogUpdater.py

A python script I'm developing to aid in transferring the important information from a distrubuter's **Catalog** to a Seller's **Cost Price Files** and **Resale Price Files**

Made to work with excel .xlsx files only

--- 

# How to Use:

1. Get your Template and folder and import it in main.py
2. Put distributer catalogs inside **/Inbox** folder
3. Inside the function *dialog* there is a list called lst[] where you can enter the 5 column letters of the original price files you want to copy to the template file
4. Run main.py
5. Check **/Outbox** folder

# Todo

<input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Before running, display imported files
<input type="checkbox" disabled /> Perhaps manually confirm which columns match up in terminal
